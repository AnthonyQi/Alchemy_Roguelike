# Alchemy_Roguelike


so... um... what's the plan bois?





One of Mr.Tomorrow's zaney ideas to seize control of this project:
-Large world map with terrain tile system, each tile representing a distinct entity, which could be procedurally generated, or manually placed in a limited, say, 20x20 map.
-Procedurally generated forests and stuff (each tile has a random number of trees based on some forest variable, and stores these trees in an array, assigning each a fixed position)
-Each turn represents a month, and the trees and tile change color depending on the time of year.
-Rather than controling a single hero, the player controls a host (medieval army) which consists of varying numbers of identical soldier sprites, which are ordered into a square by a program depending on their number.
-This game will be doable, but probably less doable than whatever y'all come up with, so it's definitely a backup plan. I have experience in making these types of games.
